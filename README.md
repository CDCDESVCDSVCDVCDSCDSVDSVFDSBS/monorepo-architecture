## Overview

This repository contains a monorepo architecture template designed for building full stack applications using NestJS, React, and GraphQL. The goal is to provide a structured and scalable way to develop applications with modern technologies. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, you can download and execute the latest release from [here](https://github.com/CDCDESVCDSVCDVCDSCDSVDSVFDSBS/monorepo-architecture/releases). Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional, for Redis)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CDCDESVCDSVCDVCDSCDSVDSVFDSBS/monorepo-architecture.git
   cd monorepo-architecture
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configurations.

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for your API, providing a more efficient way to fetch data.
- **Apollo**: A GraphQL client for React.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript.
- **BullMQ**: A powerful library for managing jobs and queues.
- **Redis**: A fast in-memory data structure store.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **NX**: A smart, extensible build framework.

## Features

- Full stack application structure with backend and frontend.
- Integrated GraphQL API.
- Job management with BullMQ.
- Shared libraries for common functionalities.
- Easy to extend and customize.

## Usage

### Backend

The backend is built with NestJS. It serves the GraphQL API and handles all business logic. You can add new resolvers, services, and modules as needed.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React. It uses Apollo Client to interact with the GraphQL API. You can create new components and pages in the `frontend/src` directory.

### Running Tests

To run tests for the backend:

```bash
npm run test
```

For the frontend:

```bash
npm run test:frontend
```
